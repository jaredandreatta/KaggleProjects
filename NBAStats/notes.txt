Step-by-Step Approach

Data Preparation:
-Ensure that player identifiers are consistent between the regular season and playoff datasets.
-Filter relevant columns, specifically focusing on PLAYER_ID, PLAYER, TEAM, year, FG3_PCT.

Calculate Average FG3_PCT:
-Compute the average FG3_PCT for each player in the regular season and the playoffs for each year.

Calculate Difference in FG3_PCT:
-Calculate the difference between the playoff FG3_PCT and regular season FG3_PCT for each player.

Statistical Distribution:
-Create a distribution of these differences to visualize the overall trend.

Identify Top and Bottom Performers:
-Determine the top 10% and bottom 10% of players based on their FG3_PCT differences.

Distribution Plot:
-Plot a histogram or kernel density estimate (KDE) of the differences in FG3_PCT to observe the distribution shape.

Top and Bottom Performers:
-List the players who fall into the top 10% and bottom 10% based on their FG3_PCT differences.

Contextual Analysis:
-Provide additional context by analyzing whether these players' performances had a significant impact on their teams' success in the playoffs.
